Remove shortcuts from Trello for people who don't use them.

Trello shortcuts can be dangerous because they are very easy to make by mistake and can heavily alter cards.

This feature was requested a long time ago but Trello still hasn't taken the time to implement it (see [this](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Trello-questions/Is-it-possible-to-modify-or-disable-keyboard-shortcuts/qaq-p/589535))
So this plugin does it.
